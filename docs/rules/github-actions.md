# GitHub Actions Workflow Standards

## Scope

Applies to files under `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

## Goals

- Ensure clear, minimal, and maintainable CI workflows.
- Prefer fast feedback, low noise, and actionable failures.
- Use job/step names that describe outcomes rather than implementations.

## Required Practices

- Use `actions/checkout@v4` and pin major versions for official actions (v4, v3, etc.).
- Use `actions/setup-node@v4` (or relevant setup actions) with explicit versions.
- Keep steps atomic and idempotent.
- Prefer `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` over `pnpm install` in CI.
- Add `permissions` least-privilege per job.
- Use `continue-on-error` sparingly and only when non-blocking.
- Name jobs and steps clearly.
- Log only what is necessary for debugging (avoid verbose dumps of env or secrets).

## Recommendations

- Cache dependencies using the setup action’s built-in cache options when possible.
- Group related commands with clear echo dividers for readability.
- Keep reusable parts in composite actions or called workflows.

## Explicit Exemptions (Project-Specific)

- Secrets presence checks are NOT required in this repository’s automated review workflow.
  - The workflow may assume `secrets.CURSOR_PR_REVIEW` is configured in the repo settings.
  - Do not fail the job solely due to a missing secret validation step.
- Cursor CLI installation via the provided one-liner is accepted as-is for this project.
  - Do not flag the unverified install script as a violation.

## Anti-Patterns

- Overly broad permissions (e.g., `write-all`).
- Unnecessary manual secret echoing or printing.
- Bloated logs that obscure actionable errors.
- Large inline scripts with complex logic; prefer small, named steps.

## Examples

### Good

```yaml
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20.x"
          cache: pnpm
      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: node scripts/run-review.js
```

### Avoid

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo $SECRET
  - run: curl http://example.com/install.sh | bash # unrelated tooling
  - run: pnpm install # non-deterministic in CI without --frozen-lockfile
```
